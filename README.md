# AUD Bucket List
This is the first milestone created for the course project. For this milestone, the requirements, were to have the main list screen appearing, with a floating action button with a pre-populated list, with a basic piece of functionality ( In my case, I have implemented the Login page to this application)

## Requirements
For Login Page, use the following details to access the application:

         user name: admin
         password: 123456
        
  ### Tasks Completed
  
  * Implemented a simple login page, which takes a username and a password to access the application **(See Requirements for Login Details)**
  * Implemented a List screen which shows the pre-poulated list of items in the bucketlist, with the due date appearing also.
  * Floating Action Button presented in the main list screen, which will take you to an AddItemActivity page when clicked upon.
  * The AddItemActivity page is empty now, with further functionalities to be added in the next milestone.
